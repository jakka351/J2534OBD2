# J2534 OBD2
  <a href="https://testerpresent.com.au/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Tester Present -Specialist Automotive Solutions-blue" /></a>    

OBD2 Tool via J2534 interface. Developed using an [OBDxPro FT](https://obdxpro.com/product/obdx-pro-fx-ford-obd2-j2534-diagnostics-and-tuning/) J2534 tool. I haven't published the code as I was asked not to share the J2534 implementation I am using by the author, so closed source, but free for all. 

## Updates
V1.0 Published, still a work in progress. Can use Mode $09 to read Vehicle VIN and ECU Calibration, Modes $03 & $04 to Read & Clear DTC and Modes $01 & $02 PIDS are implemented. Still a lot of work to do with regards to parsing the data recieved from the ECU.

## User Interface
